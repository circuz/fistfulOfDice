# For a Fistful of Dice 

This is a small video project about "simulating" some dice with other dice.


**This all started a long time ago on a night, not unlike this one.** *pan to raining/storming outside, then transition to inside flashback (maybe bar to get easy location).*

**We were setting up to play usselves some top-a-the-table role playin' games.** *Western is placed on the table, maybe some extras in the background packing up notebooks/dice talking in 0.6x or smth. Whatever just make the scenography look nice.*

**Thats... when I realized i forgot my dice** *whip pan and move closed upon realization*

`I forgot my dice` **I said** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*

`You forgot your dice?` **They asked** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*

`I forgot my dice` **I answered** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*
