# For a Fistful of Dice 

This is a small video project about "simulating" some dice with other dice.

All flashbacks should probably be sepia or black and white


**This all started a long time ago on a night, not unlike this one.** *pan to raining/storming outside, then transition to inside flashback (maybe bar to get easy location).*

**We were setting up to play usselves some top-a-the-table role playin' games.** *Western is placed on the table, maybe some extras in the background packing up notebooks/dice talking in 0.6x or smth. Whatever just make the scenography look nice.*

**Thats... when I realized i forgot my dice** *whip pan and move closed upon realization*

`I forgot my dice` **I said** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*

`You forgot your dice?` **They asked** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*

`I forgot my dice` **I answered** *Lipsync talkover audio with flashback*

`Here!`**Said a stranger**`use mine` *focus pull to me in a different outfit (preferably with a high hat so someone else can don it and laugh in the background of every other shot), the stranger is holding his hand palmside down in a fist*

**As a believer in the good in all hearts I tipped my hat to this handsome stranger and extended my hand** *From above we see the stranger's outstretched hand as protagonist's hand comes into frame and goes below the stranger's. The stranger's hand retracts as protagonist's hand closes.*

**But to my dismay..the dice...were all D6** *Front view...over the shoulder down at hand...front view screaming and shaking head vigorously*
